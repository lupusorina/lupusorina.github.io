I hope you find them interesting as well and maybe one day, someone will pick up on these ideas and make them a reality.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about the possibility of predicting the future by modelling the influence of each person‚Äôs decisions on the world.</p>

<p>üëª Fun fact: As a child, my summers at my grandparents‚Äô house included a post-lunch tradition.
We‚Äôd gather around the table for Turkish coffee, brewed in the traditional style that left a thick layer of grounds at the bottom of each cup. 
After finishing our drinks, my grandmother, a chemist and food engineer with a whimsical side, would pretend to read our fortunes from the coffee grounds.
It was all in good fun; we knew she was making up stories, but her tales were always optimistic, filled with bright futures.
Her fascination with the mystical was a playful contrast to her scientific background‚Äîmuch like how my generation turns to puppies on Instagram for entertainment, her generation embraced the mystical for their fun.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been fascinated by the possibility of using a tool to predict the future.
Instead of relying on something whimsical like my grandmother‚Äôs coffee grounds,
what if we harnessed the power of AI?
Of course, I‚Äôm not suggesting that we analyze coffee grounds with a segmentation model‚Äîthat would be far-fetched.
But imagine if we could model the cumulative impact of individual decisions on a global scale.
Could we potentially forecast future events and trends?</p>

<h2 id="1-how-do-the-decisions-from-one-person-influence-the-outcomes-of-another-person">1. How do the decisions from one person influence the outcomes of another person?</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs consider an example to illustrate the potential of AI in predicting and preventing adverse scenarios:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Imagine two individuals, Person A and Person B.
Person A decides to drive after consuming alcohol one evening,
while Person B plans to visit In-N-Out for a burger.
Unfortunately, due to Person A's impaired driving, an accident occurs,
and Person B becomes involved because their path intersects with Person A's.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This situation could potentially be mitigated with the help of AI.
For instance, an AI system could analyze factors such as Person A‚Äôs alcohol consumption and the timing of their decision to drive, and it could warn them of the high risk of causing an accident, advising against driving.
Simultaneously, the AI could alert Person B about the increased risk of accidents along their route to In-N-Out, suggesting they delay their trip or choose a different destination.</p>

<p>This concept is related to the AI‚Äôs ability to simulate multiple future scenarios
based on real-time data, evaluating the outcomes of various decisions to provide timely warnings.</p>

<p>However, implementing such a system raises significant privacy concerns.
It would require continuous access to personal data and decision-making insights, a prospect that might be more palatable in a future where technologies like Neuralink have normalized the integration of AI in daily decision-making.
While this could dramatically enhance safety and decision-making efficiency, it also opens up a complex debate about privacy, autonomy, and the extent to which we are willing to allow AI to influence our lives.</p>

<h2 id="2-voting-and-future-of-the-world">2. Voting and future of the world.</h2>

<p>The process of voting has always captivated me,
particularly how it seems we make such significant decisions‚Äîlike choosing a representative‚Äîwith relatively little information. So silly!
While the media aims to inform us, their coverage can often be biased or even exacerbate misunderstandings.
Additionally, voters come from diverse educational backgrounds and are influenced by various social factors such as friends and family.</p>

<p>Consider how frequently political candidates make campaign promises,
only to pursue markedly different agendas once in office.
This discrepancy between promises and actions leads to a possibility: what if we could use AI to predict the likely outcomes of a candidate‚Äôs tenure based on their past decisions, historical data, and broader national history?</p>

<p>Imagine an AI-driven outcome tree for each candidate.
This model could predict, for instance, a 20 percent chance that a candidate might initiate a conflict, or a 30 percent likelihood of raising taxes.
Such predictions could empower voters to make more informed decisions, choosing candidates not just based on promises but on probable outcomes.</p>

<p>We always say: history repeats itself. 
Given that history often shows patterns of repetition, leveraging this data to predict future political actions seems both logical and feasible.
Modeling such a system would involve complex algorithms capable of analyzing vast datasets to identify trends and predict future events.
This would undoubtedly be a challenging yet fascinating problem to tackle, potentially revolutionizing how we approach voting and political analysis.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="future_ideas" /><category term="AI" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Predicting the future with AI]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Review Book ‚ÄúBecoming Bulletproof‚Äù by Evy Poumpouras (work in progress)</title><link href="https://lupusorina.github.io/blog/2025/books_bulletproof/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review Book ‚ÄúBecoming Bulletproof‚Äù by Evy Poumpouras (work in progress)" /><published>2025-02-25T13:39:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-25T13:39:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lupusorina.github.io/blog/2025/books_bulletproof</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lupusorina.github.io/blog/2025/books_bulletproof/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="review-of-the-book-becoming-bulletproof-by-evy-poumpouras-work-in-progress">Review of the book ‚ÄúBecoming Bulletproof‚Äù by Evy Poumpouras (work in progress)</h2>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="books" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Review Book "Becoming Bulletproof" by Evy Poumpouras]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Review Book ‚ÄúLessons from the Lobster.

Eve Marder‚Äôs Work in Neuroscience‚Äù</h2>

<p>I recently finished reading ‚ÄúLessons from the Lobster‚Äù, a book recommended by a student after my lecture on reinforcement learning and intelligence.</p>

<p>The book provides a detailed description of Eve Marder‚Äôs work in neuroscience, from her childhood to her current role as a professor at Brandeis University.
As a roboticist with almost no background in neuroscience, I found the book a bit difficult to follow when complex biology details were presented, so I skipped those parts and focused on the general ideas and lessons that I could apply to my work.</p>

<p>Marder‚Äôs research focuses on the neural circuits in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of lobsters, a small but remarkably flexible neural network consisting of just 30 neurons. 
This simplicity makes the STG a great model for studying neural circuits.
What‚Äôs interesting from the book is that even if there are only a few neurons, by doing neuromodulation, the STG can fire very differently. So such a small circuit is very flexible and can generate a wide range of behaviors.</p>

<p>I would recommend the book to anyone interested in neuroscience, biology, or even robotics, as it provides a great example of how to study a complex system by focusing on a small part of it. Maybe one day I‚Äôll learn more about biology and neuroscience and I‚Äôll be able to understand the book in more detail.</p>

It helps you and your team understand the changes you‚Äôve made and why you made them.
Oftentimes, as PhD students, we tend to work alone and not care that much about the commit messages. However, when you start working with a team, you‚Äôll realize how important it is to write good commit messages and to stage your files properly.
To me, setting up good practices and good workflows from the beginning is really important.</p>

<p>One command I really like is</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="what-is-git-add--p">What is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add -p</code>?</h3>

<p>This command initiates an interactive staging session that allows you to selectively stage portions of a file.
This is particularly useful when you‚Äôve made changes to a file and want to commit only some of those changes.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-git-add--p">How to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add -p</code>?</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs really easy. Just type</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add -p
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and then git will present you with a series of options.</p>

<p>For example, some that I use a lot are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‚Äòy‚Äô to stage this hunk</li>
  <li>‚Äòn‚Äô to not stage this hunk</li>
  <li>‚Äôs‚Äô to split this hunk</li>
  <li>‚Äòq‚Äô to quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones</li>

This experience offered me a great opportunity to learn more about the science behind sample return missions and the challenges faced by the scientists and engineers involved in these missions.
As an engineer, I‚Äôm keen to bridge the gap between engineering and the scientific principles underlying different missions.</p>

<p>This course also resonated with a question that deeply interests me: ‚ÄúWhere and how can we discover life within the Solar System and beyond?‚Äù</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a brief summary of what I‚Äôve learned:</p>

<h4 id="talk-1-past-sample-return-missions-and-major-achievements-by-m-zolensky-nasa-johnson-space-center"><strong>Talk 1.</strong> Past Sample Return Missions and Major Achievements, by M. Zolensky, NASA Johnson Space Center</h4>

<p>He gave examples of sample return missions from the Moon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Samples from Lunar Near Side: Luna, Apollo, Chang‚Äôe missions</li>
  <li>Samples from Lunar Far Side: Chang‚Äôe</li>
</ul>

<p>and talked about some major unanswered questions, such as the nature and amount of water at the south pole, details about the bombardment history, and possible involvement with early life emergence on Earth.</p>

<p>Then, the Genesis mission (figure below) was presented, which was launched in August 2001 to collect solar wind samples and return them to Earth. Some of the major results of this mission include the measurement of O isotope abundances.</p>

<p>Then, he talked about some experiments that were conducted to collect astroid and comet dust, such as the Long Duration Exposure Facility (figure below). ‚ÄúThe Long Duration Exposure Facility, or LDEF, was a cylindrical facility designed to provide long-term experimental data on the outer space environment and its effects on space systems, materials, operations and selected spores‚Äô survival.‚Äù It was placed in Low Earth Orbit by the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984 and was retrieved by the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1990. (source: Wikipedia).
There were also some experiments conducted on the ISS, such as the Tanpopo experiments, which used silica gel to collect micrometeorites.</p>

<!-- Requirements of these samples drove great advances in analytical techniques. -->

<!-- Asteroids are separated in terms of reflectance spectrum. -->
<p>Some examples of astroid sample return missions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hayabusa recovered &lt; 1g material</li>
  <li>Hayabusa2 recovered 5.4 grams</li>
  <li>OSIRIS-REx recovered 121 grams</li>
</ul>

<p>Kind of crazy to think how little material was recovered from these missions, but how much we can learn from them. And one important thing to note is that the samples must be returned in a vacuum, as they are extremely reactive to everything on Earth.</p>

<p>Some examples of comet sample return missions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stardust: 81P/Wild 2</li>
  <li>Rosetta from 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</li>
</ul>

<p>I also learnt that the ‚ÄúP‚Äù in 67P stands for Period comet.</p>

<p>Some other lessons learned: samples must be returned in an airtight container. Hhe health and safety should be 
the primary mission priority, sample analysis techniques continue to evolve, team membership should be very inclusive and flexible and samples will be extremely reactive to everything on Earth.</p>

<p>I really love learning about all the different space missions and the science behind them. When I was in high school, I had this challenge with myself to learn by heart all the different NASA missions to date.</p>

<h4 id="talk-2-linking-the-protosolar-disk-with-the-inner-solar-system-by-prof-fran√ßois-tissot"><strong>Talk 2</strong> ‚ÄúLinking the protosolar disk with the inner Solar System‚Äù, by Prof. Fran√ßois Tissot.</h4>

<p>He started by presenting the different types of meteorites:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stony meteorites, from crusts/mantles</li>
  <li>Iron meteortites, from cores</li>
  <li>Stony-iron meteorites</li>
  <li>Chondrites (figure below)</li>
</ul>

<p>He talked about isotope anomalies.
There were quite some details that were hard to follow for me, because I am not a geologist,
but I got the general idea. Maybe I should do a 3rd Masters in geology.</p>

<p>He also mentioned that Venus return missions are very important.
I also learned about the chrondritic model, which models the composition of Earth. Scientists are arguing whether this model is correct or not.
Also, that isotopic anomalies are very important for understanding the formation of the solar system.</p>

<h4 id="talk-3-dynamical-evolution-by-prof-karen-meech"><strong>Talk 3</strong> ‚ÄúDynamical Evolution‚Äù by Prof. Karen Meech</h4>

<p>I really wish I would have attended this talk, but I had to attend another meeting at that time. I will try to find the recording and watch it.</p>

<h4 id="talk-4-ocean-worlds-and-habitability-by-prof-jonathan-lunine"><strong>Talk 4</strong> Ocean Worlds and Habitability, by Prof. Jonathan Lunine</h4>

<p>Some of the facts I learned from the talk are below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oceanworld are bodies with substantial liquid water on their surfaces or within their interiors. They are very interesting for astrobiology.</li>
  <li>Habitability requires that three or four general conditions be met: energy, appropriate physical and chemical conditions, solvent, and elemental requirements.</li>
  <li>Conditions for abiogenesis is still a mystery (habitability bottleneck).</li>
  <li>Types of measurements to require habilitability: geophysical, chemical, isotopic, and electromagnetic.</li>
  <li>The oceans of Europa were discovered by a magnetometer on Galileo.</li>
</ul>

<p>Saturn‚Äôs moon Enceladus (figure below) is one of the easiest to explore. There is evidence of an ocean. 
There are organics in the Enceladus ocean, but their identity is not known.
There is evidence there is redox chemistry in the ocean of Enceladus.</p>

<p>Europa Clipper will orbit Jupiter and make 50 fly-bys of Europa. 
For ocean worlds, present-day habitability can be established by in-situ measurements.</p>

<p>I liked that he presented both pros and cons for sample return missions.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know, but during the early solar system, the planets were closer together.
He also showed and explained us plots of reflectance spectra (reflectance vs. wavelength), which was very interesting to see.</p>

<p>I also realized I wish I would know more about chemistry.</p>

However, the initial design required the robot to step quickly, making testing by myself extremely challenging.
Now, it‚Äôs time to invest in designing the actuated ankles.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>I consider three options:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>motor + low gear ratio (cable-driven)</strong>
<br /> üëç: It is a compact design
<br /> üëé:  Less experience designing this. The cable needs to not stretch over time.</li>
  <li><strong>motor + low gear ratio (belt-driven)</strong>
<br /> üëç: experience designing belt-driven actuators, as I‚Äôve already designed some for the knee and yaw joints.
<br /> üëé: It might be too bulky/heavy</li>
  <li><strong>series elastic actuators</strong>
<br />  üëç: Can absorb impacts better
<br />  üëé: Less experience designing this. I need to find a way to measure the spring deflection.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="controls">Controls</h3>

<p>For the control, I would like to employ a straightforward feedback law. I‚Äôm not trying at this point to do something very complicated, because I want to get the robot to walk first.
So I want something along the lines of 
\(u = - k_p x_{zmp} - k_d v,\)
 where zmp stands for zero moment point.
 Initially, I was thinking to use the velocity of the zmp. However, I believe that signal will be too noisy.
So I can use the ankle velocity computed geometrically as the robot moves forward.</p>

<hr />

<p>I decided to go with the series elastic actuators, so I‚Äôll document the sizing, manufacturing, and testing in a separate blog post.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="robotics" /><category term="biped" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to design ankles that are actuated]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">loose connectors</title><link href="https://lupusorina.github.io/blog/2024/connectors/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="loose connectors" /><published>2024-07-24T13:39:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-24T13:39:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lupusorina.github.io/blog/2024/connectors</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lupusorina.github.io/blog/2024/connectors/"><![CDATA[<p>One of the main challenges I‚Äôve faced with connectors for my biped‚Äôs motors is preventing them from being under excessive tension.
As the robot moves its legs, significant mechanical stress can be applied to these connectors, and if this stress is not properly managed, the connectors can become loose over time.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, I have two GIFs: one showing a connector without proper mechanical stress relief and one where the stress relief was implemented properly.</p>

<p>One issue arising from unstable power supplies is the potential for voltage drops or spikes on the CANbus.
This can lead to many problems, including motor drivers breaking.
For example, one of my MJBots motor driver recently signaled Fault 33, indicating a likely malfunction.
According to the <a href="https://github.com/mjbots/moteus/blob/main/docs/reference.md">documentation</a>, it means: ‚Äúthe most common reason for this is undervoltage, moteus attempted to draw more current than the supply could provide.‚Äù
MJBots provides really nice tech support on their Discord channels, so according to them: ‚ÄúThat indicates damage to the gate driver or fets or both‚Äù. I ordered a new motor driver, which just arrived, so I‚Äôll solder it real quick.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I‚Äôve asked one of my summer students, Cesar, to design a mount to be able to attach the cables more securely.</p>
