I should start by saying that I don't really like making predictions. I'd rather build the future I want than try to predict it. The truth is, everyone can build the future they want, if you want something badly enough, you will achieve it.

But... I'm writing this post mostly for fun, and because I just finished *Superforecasting*, by Dan Gardner and Philip E. Tetlock, which inspired me to do so.

I'm 33 years old. These are my predictions for the next 25 years.
The order is random. I'll keep track of them every year.



### Faster ways of transportation

Whether through much more efficient airplanes or rocket-based point-to-point travel, we will find ways to move across the planet much faster. Perhaps even modes we are even not imagining now. I'm not talking about incremental 10 - 20% improvements. I mean 50 - 80% reductions in travel time. A New York - Zurich trip could take ~2 hours instead of 7 - 8 hours. 


### Finding life on other planet

Maybe it's bacteria. Maybe it's technosignatures, but more likely bacteria … or a giraffe, haha.

This could happen through humans going to the Moon and Mars and finding something there, or through AI explorers we send to places humans can't easily reach, or can't communicate with.

### Different forms of governance

In a connected world, power will shift more toward people and away from rigid, hierarchical systems centered on a single leader governing massive populations. Switzerland already does this relatively well: 7 presidents, frequent voting, real participation. But I think we'll go further. Read for example ''Network State”, by Balaji Srinivasan and you will understand what I mean. 


### Hotels on the moon

We'll have hotels on the Moon. Just like people travel to New York or Paris for holidays today, future vacations will include the Moon. We'll build infrastructure there, habitats, transportation, and buildings that look very different from anything on Earth. Mars might follow too, though I'm a bit less certain about that timeline.

### We will find ways to monetize space

Space can't be funded forever just by taxpayer money and a handful of billionaires. To scale, we need sustainable economic models. Maybe that's asteroid mining. Maybe in-orbit manufacturing. Maybe something we haven't even imagined yet.

### Hybrid organisms

My biology knowledge is limited, so take this one with a grain of salt, but I think we'll see hybrid constructs: part biological, part mechanical.

They may be radiation-resistant, self-healing, and able to survive environments where traditional robots fail. We could send them to other planets.
If you want intuition for this idea, read The Murderbot Diaries, by Martha Wells.


### Brain interfaces

Right now, Neuralink-like devices are mostly used for people who can't move.
In the future, these interfaces will become more common. People will use them to control computers, phones, and devices directly, and maybe even to record experiences. Perhaps they could be used during space-travel to play back memories of loved ones.

### Customized medical care

Medicine will become far more personal.
We'll have continuous health monitoring, possibly in places like toilet or everyday objects, and doctors will prescribe treatments tailored specifically to your biology, not the statistical average.

That's all.

This is the future I want to see …
