I've been fortunate to be a TA for several undergraduate and graduate classes at Caltech and at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL).

## Caltech

--------------

**2023 - 2024**

[CS/EE/ME 75 bc](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cseeme-75-abc) - undergraduate level class

Instructor: Prof. Soon-Jo Chung, Dr. Kalind Carpenter (JPL)

For this class, I envisioned and supervised three innovative projects, ensuring their successful completion by the students. The projects were: (1) Adaptive landing gear for rough terrain (2) Shuttle robot with ML-infused detection for craters on the moon, and (3) Rappelling of two Traxxas robots down a slope.

The class ended in a highly successful presentation at Caltech's Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST). The event attracted the attention of many high-profile individuals from Caltech and JPL. During the presentation, students performed successful live demonstrations.

**2022 - 2023**

[CDS245](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cds-245) - graduate level class

Instructor: Prof. Soon-Jo Chung

For this class, I supervised students for projects that combine data-driven methods with classical control theory. 


--------------

**2021 - 2022**

Together with a colleague, I prepared three concise textbooks summarizing the key concepts of mathematics, fluid dynamics, and control classes. These resources were specifically designed for the Qualifying Exam at Caltech. 
These notes are being used since then by multiple generations of Aerospace students, serving as valuable study aids for this exam.

## EPFL

-------------

[MATH-101(e)](https://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!itffichecours.htm?ww_i_matiere=1705590&ww_x_anneeacad=2305107546&ww_i_section=249847&ww_i_niveau=6683111&ww_c_langue=en)

Instructor: Anna Lachowska

During my Master's at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), I served as a TA for Analysis I and II.
I helped students understand the course material during designated tutoring hours. 
Unlike the office hour system at Caltech, EPFL students meet with TAs during specific times to collaboratively work through exercises and ask questions.
I tutored these sessions in both English and French.
