I've been fortunate to be a TA for several undergraduate and graduate classes at Caltech and at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL).

[CDS 110](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cds-110) - **Analysis and Design of Feedback Control Systems** - undergraduate and graduate level class

**Instructor:** Prof. Eric Mazumdar

For this class, I wrote homework problems and solutions (3 homeworks out of 8 total), held office hours, gave 2 guest lecture on adaptive control and reinforcement learning, and graded homeworks.

[CS 163](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cs-163) - **Projects in Machine Learning**

**Instructor:** Prof. Katie Bouman

For this class, I supervised a group of students working on a project that involved reinforcement learning and computer vision. I helped them understand the theory behind the algorithms they were using and guided them in the implementation of their project.

[CS/EE/ME 75 bc](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cseeme-75-abc) - **Multidisciplinary Systems Engineering** - undergraduate level class

**Instructor:** Prof. Soon-Jo Chung, Kalind Carpenter (JPL)

For this class, I envisioned and supervised three innovative projects, ensuring their successful completion by the students. The projects were: (1) Adaptive landing gear for rough terrain (2) Shuttle robot with ML-infused detection for craters on the moon, and (3) Rappelling of two Traxxas robots down a slope.

The class ended in a highly successful presentation at Caltech's Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST). The event attracted the attention of many high-profile individuals from Caltech and JPL. During the presentation, students performed successful live demonstrations.

[CDS245](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/courses/cds-245) - **Data-driven Control** - graduate level class

**Instructor:** Prof. Soon-Jo Chung

For this class, I supervised students for projects that combine data-driven methods with classical control theory.

Together with a colleague, I prepared three concise textbooks summarizing the key concepts of mathematics, fluid dynamics, and control classes. These resources were specifically designed for the Qualifying Exam at Caltech. 
These notes are being used since then by multiple generations of Aerospace students, serving as valuable study aids for this exam.

**Instructor:** Prof. Anna Lachowska

During my Master's at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), I served as a TA for Analysis I and II.
I helped students understand the course material during designated tutoring hours. 
Unlike the office hour system at Caltech where students work through homework problems, EPFL students meet with TAs during specific times to collaboratively work through exercises given by the instructor specifically for the OHs.
I tutored these sessions in both English and French.
